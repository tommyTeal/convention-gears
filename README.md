# convention-gears
I made some oval gears that hat have some mass to them and am turning them with a Nema 23 stepper motor but am concerned about the mass of the gears and for the sake of learning want to exclude an encoder and home proximity switch. But could use some help with taking it to that level from just the Arduino, driver, and stepper motor I have now.
